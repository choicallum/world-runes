# World Runes Solver

This is a webapp that calculates the optimal teamcomps to solve the TFT Augment "The World Runes" with.

The World Runes reads that you must field 4 regions on your board for a few turns to get a large reward -- thus completing this as soon as possible is important! The augment also gives you a few emblems, which can cause confusion as to what is the optimal way to play, which this calculator aims to solve.
